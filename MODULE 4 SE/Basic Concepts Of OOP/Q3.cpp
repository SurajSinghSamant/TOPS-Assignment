// What is the difference between OOP and POP?

/* Ans. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and POP (Procedural Oriented Programming) are two fundamental approaches to structuring programs. Here's a breakdown of their key differences :
 
 Core Concept :

1. OOP: Organizes programs around objects. An object encapsulates data (properties) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data. It represents a real-world entity with its own state and behavior.
 
 POP : Organizes programs around procedures (functions). Procedures are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks. The program flow is dictated by the sequence in which these procedures are called.
 
 2. Data Focus :

 OOP : Emphasizes data protection. Data is typically hidden within objects (encapsulation) and can only be accessed through the object's methods. This promotes data integrity and reduces the risk of accidental modification.
 
 POP : Data is often global or passed between procedures as arguments. This can lead to issues like unintended side effects if data is not carefully managed.
 
 3. Code Reusability :

 OOP : Encourages code reusability through inheritance. Classes can inherit properties and methods from parent classes, allowing for code specialization.
 
 POP : Reusability is achieved through functions, but there's no built-in mechanism for creating hierarchical relationships between functions.
 
 4. Complexity Management :

 OOP : Well-suited for complex projects as it promotes modularity and code organization. Objects can be combined to create larger systems with clear boundaries.
 
 POP : Can become difficult to manage in large projects due to potential data sharing problems and lack of clear organization between procedures.
 
 Examples :

 OOP : Java, Python, C++
 
 POP : C, Pascal, FORTRAN
 
 Choosing Between OOP and POP :

 OOP is generally preferred for complex applications where data protection, reusability, and maintainability are crucial.
 
 POP can still be a good choice for smaller projects or situations where speed and simplicity are priorities.
 Ultimately, the best approach depends on the specific needs of the project.
