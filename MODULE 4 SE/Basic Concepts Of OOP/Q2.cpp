// What is OOP? List OOP concepts

/* Ans : OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a way of structuring programs around objects that act as real-world entities. These objects combine data (like properties or attributes) with the functions (often called methods) that operate on that data.

 Here are some of the core concepts in OOP:

 1. Classes : A blueprint that defines the properties and methods that objects of that class will have. Imagine a class as a cookie cutter that creates objects of a specific shape.
 
 2. Objects : An instance of a class. Think of an object as an individual cookie created from the cookie cutter. Objects can hold data and carry out actions defined by the class.
 
 3. Encapsulation : Bundling data and methods together within a class to protect the data from being accessed or modified directly. This is like keeping the recipe (the data) and baking instructions (the methods) together for the cookie, and only allowing access through approved channels.
 
 4. Inheritance : Creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and methods from existing classes (superclasses). This is like creating a new cookie recipe (subclass) based on an existing sugar cookie recipe (superclass), but maybe adding chocolate chips (a new property).
 
 5. Polymorphism : The ability of objects to respond differently to the same message. For example, a "draw" method might be used to draw a circle or a square on the screen, depending on the type of object.
 
 6. Constructor : A special method in a class that automatically gets called when you create a new object. It's like a blueprint builder, initializing the object's properties with starting values.
 
 7. Destructor : The opposite of a constructor, a destructor is a method called when an object is destroyed (goes out of scope). It's used for any necessary cleanup, like freeing up memory. Not all languages have destructors, and some rely on garbage collection.
 
 8. Abstraction : Focusing on the essential details of an object and hiding the implementation details. It's like using a remote control for a TV. You push a button, but you don't need to know the complex electronics behind making the picture change. Abstraction allows you to interact with objects without worrying about their inner workings.
 
 9. Templates : Templates are a powerful feature for writing generic code. They allow you to create functions and classes that can work with different data types without needing to rewrite the code for each type.
